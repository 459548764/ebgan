# EBGAN
A tensorflow implementation of Junbo et al's Energy-based generative adversarial network ( EBGAN ) paper. 
( See : [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03126v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03126v2.pdf) )
My implementation is somewhat different from original papers, for example I've used convolution layers
in both generator and discriminator instead of fully connected layers.
I think this isn't important and will not make a big difference in the final result.

## Version

Current Version : __***0.0.0.2***__

## Dependencies ( VERSION MUST BE MATCHED EXACTLY! )

1. tensorflow == 1.0.0 
1. sugartensor == 1.0.0.2

## Training the network

Execute
<pre><code>
python mnist_ebgan_train.py
</code></pre>
to train the network. You can see the result ckpt files and log files in the 'asset/train' directory.
Launch tensorboard --logdir asset/train/log to monitor training process.


## Generating image
 
Execute
<pre><code>
python mnist_ebgan_generate.py
</code></pre>
to generate sample image.  The 'sample.png' file will be generated in the 'asset/train' directory.

## Generated image sample

This image was generated by EBGAN network.
